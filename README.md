# Inventory_Management_System
Hello, I am Shubham JS Chaudhary.   
This is a project based on the application of the concept of file handling on JSON files through the implementation of an Inventory Management System.

The files present in the project are shown below with their description:
1. IMS_Purchase_Portal.ipynb  :  Jupyter Notebook with the program for customer buying products from inventory.
2. IMS_Selling_Portal.ipynb   :  Jupyter Notebook with the program for seller selling products to the inventory.
3. records.json               :  JSON File containing details of all the products present in the inventory.
4. sales.json                 :  JSON File containing details of all the customers' purchase transactions.
5. purchases.json             :  JSON File containing details of all the sellers' selling transactions.
